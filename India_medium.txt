India, a place of absolute beatitude
1. Unity in diversity
This quote suits well for India.. I’m an Indian, I love India.. But it’s just not because the fact that I’m an Indian, but it’s because of the people of the country. One could see a variety of people here belonging to different religions, different races.
2. Languages and dialects
People here speak different languages. In fact there are around 150 languages spoken in the country.. That’s a huge count right!
3.People here
I’m from southern part of India.. But, I like the whole country, because wherever you go across the nation, you could find pleasant people all around that will make you feel at home.
4.Culture
The Indian culture dates back to centuries. India not only has a great culture, but also has an ancient traditional way of living. Though these kind of living are fading away day by day, one could still find these ancient traditions in the remote part of the country.
5. Life in India
Life in India is quite different from any other country. One could see a highly sophisticated way of life in parts of India and a traditional way of life as well. Country sides and cities host a drastic difference.
These are the reasons that India is called the country of unity in diversity. One should visit India atleast once in a lifetime to know what is life!
